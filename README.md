# Drowsiness-Detection
Developed a real-time Drowsiness Detection system using OpenCV and Keras to enhance road safety by alerting drivers when signs of fatigue are detected through facial landmark analysis.

This repository contains code for a drowsiness detection system using OpenCV and Keras. The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze video frames captured by a webcam and detect signs of drowsiness in a person's eyes.

## Features

- Real-time drowsiness detection using a webcam
- Eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation to detect closed eyes
- CNN-based classification of eye states (open or closed)
- Alerts the user when drowsiness is detected

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
